Project Description: 


The project I undertook revolves around capturing the various elements that NYUAD (New York University Abu Dhabi) students typically encounter throughout their journey. The overall concept and theme of this project can be described as a casual and interactive online experience. The primary objective was to create a website that incoming students could explore to gain some view into what their life at NYUAD might be like.

The concept draws inspiration from my own experiences as an NYUAD student, seeking to offer a glimpse into the vibrant and diverse community and unique cultural blend that characterizes the university.

How did you go about implementing the concept?


First, I sketched out wireframes and user flows, ensuring a seamless navigation experience.
Secondly, I build the html and css file one for the content and the other for the positioning and styling. Then I add javascript for usre interactinos.


Reflecting on the journey from concept to the final working version of my project, it's clear that my initial expectations and goals haven't been entirely met. One of my primary goals was to provide comprehensive information and data, but I acknowledge that there's room for improvement in this aspect. While I've made progress, I believe that the depth and breadth of information could be expanded further to better meet user needs.

Additionally, I've recognized the need to enhance my visualization skills. Visual elements play a significant role in conveying information effectively, and I aspire to create more visually compelling and informative graphics and charts. This will not only improve the overall user experience but also aid in conveying complex data in a more digestible manner.
